`patientTests` is a ternary relationship set. 

Another method is, to make the `testsAndExaminations` entity a weak entity having identifying
entity set `Patient`. And then adding a relationship set between the weak entity `testsAndExaminations`
and `MedicalDoctor`, representing which medical doctor performed which test and examination.
